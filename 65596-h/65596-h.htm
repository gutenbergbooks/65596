  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The treatment of the material used in this volume
will be found somewhat different from that
adopted in the two preceding. The narrower field
of inquiry makes possible a closer following of the
ordinary chronological method of arrangement rather
than the topical method of the other volumes. An
attempt is made to trace the history of printing in England
through the centuries from Caxton to Morris and
to include some insight into legal regulations, trade
conditions, and industrial development generally. As
before, it is to be remembered that this is a primer, a
book of introductions. No attempt, therefore, is made
to go far into details or to discuss disputed points or to
include any considerable amount of technical detail. It
is hoped that the reader will get a comprehensive view
of the subject, will feel its human interest, and will
catch some glimpse of its larger relation to the general
history of the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer has consulted a considerable range of
authorities, a few of the more accessible of which are
cited in the short list of books for supplementary reading.
Mention should be made of the very excellent
study of John Baskerville, privately printed by Col.
Josiah H. Benton, of Boston. This book may perhaps
be found in the larger public libraries. Here, as always,
it is to be regretted that although much has been written
on the subject of printing and of the history of
printing a good general history of the subject is still
greatly to be desired.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>England was slow to take up printing and slow
and backward in the development of it. It was
25 years after the invention of printing before any
printing was done in England. It was many years
after that before the work of the English printers could
compare with that done on the continent. The reason
for this is to be found in the conditions of the country
itself. Although the two great universities had long
been in existence, Oxford dating back to 1167 and Cambridge
to 1209, England as a whole was a backward
country. In culture and the refinements of civilization,
as well as in many more practical things, England was
not so far advanced as the rest of Europe nor was it to
be so for many years to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>England at this time was an agricultural and grazing
country. A colony of Flemings had been brought over
to start the cloth industry. There was still, nevertheless,
a large export of wool to Flanders, which was there
woven and sent back as cloth. The English nobles
lived largely on their estates, looking after their tenants,
hunting for diversion, and doing a little fighting
occasionally when life became otherwise unbearably
uninteresting. They were not an educated class and
the peasantry were profoundly ignorant. The cities
which, as always, depended upon manufacture and commerce
were just beginning to grow, with the exception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of some of the seaport towns which were already prosperous
and wealthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only was this general condition true, but there
were special conditions which rendered the middle of
the fifteenth century unfavorable to culture and to the
introduction of a new invention auxiliary to culture.
In 1450 England was shaken and horrified by the bloody
insurrection of peasants, with its attendant outrages,
known as Jack Cade’s Revolt. Scarcely had order been
restored when a disputed succession to the crown
plunged the country into the bloody civil war between
the adherents of the Houses of York and Lancaster,
known as the Wars of the Roses. This period of civil
strife lasted for thirty years and affected the general
welfare of England very seriously. It was especially
marked by mortality among the noblest families in the
realm, many of which were actually exterminated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time within this bloody half-century the art of
printing was introduced into England. There is in
existence a book printed in Oxford and dated on the
title page 1468. Upon the existence of this book, and
upon a somewhat doubtful legend, has been built a
claim that English printing originated in Oxford. This
claim, however, has practically ceased to be maintained.
The legend appears to be baseless, and it has
been generally concluded that the date is a misprint
and that it should be 1478, an X having been dropped
in writing the Roman date, a not uncommon error in
publications of this period. Historians have now generally
agreed that the introduction of printing in England
is due to William Caxton, one of the most interesting
figures in the whole annals of printing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caxton was born in the Weald, or wooded land, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Kent, a place of simple people and uncouth speech,
about 1421. As a boy he was apprenticed to Robert
Large, a prominent mercer or silk merchant of London.
On the death of Large, not many years later, Caxton
went to Bruges, in Belgium, then part of the territory
of the Dukes of Burgundy, and became connected with
the so-called English “Nation” or “House.” This was
a chartered company of merchant adventurers similar
to the companies which later settled certain portions of
North America and to the famous East India Company.
Caxton appears to have been successful in business and
became Governor of the English “Nation” in 1462.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bruges was at this time a city of wealth and culture,
the Flemings being far in advance of the English in
this respect. Life in these surroundings caused Caxton
to become interested in reading and good literature,
and in 1467 he undertook a translation into English
of a collection of stories of Troy, or as he called it
“Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye.” Shortly after
this, Margaret, sister of Edward IV of England, married
the Duke of Burgundy and came to Bruges to live.
Caxton immediately came into friendly relations with
the Duchess, who shortly after gave him a position in
her personal service. It is not quite clear what this
position was. It has been supposed by some that the
purpose of the Duchess was to enable Caxton to pursue
his literary labors with the special end of making continental
literature known to the English through translation.
A more probable supposition, however, is that
he was the confidential business adviser to the Duchess.
It is a well-known fact that royal personages at this
period engaged freely in trade and that sometimes they
engaged in extensive commercial transactions with other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>royal personages although trade between their two countries
might be strictly prohibited by law, as was the
case with England and Flanders during part of the reign
of Edward IV. At an early period of their friendship
Caxton showed the Duchess Margaret his unfinished
translation of the Troy stories. Fortunately for the
world, the Duchess was a friendly but candid critic.
She saw both the strength and the weakness of Caxton’s
work, and while she took him to task roundly
for his rough and poor English she encouraged and
commanded him to complete his translation and at the
same time improve himself in English. Caxton thereupon
renewed his work and completed the translation
of the Troy stories at Cologne in 1471.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caxton was immediately besieged with demands for
copies of his translations, which, of course, he was unable
to furnish, although he appears to have worked at
it until time, strength, and eyesight failed. He thereupon
determined to learn the new art of printing so that
he might by that means multiply copies of this and other
works which he might execute. Unquestionably he saw
printing presses in operation in Cologne. It has been
claimed that he learned to print there, and this claim
receives some support from an ambiguous statement
attributed to him many years later by Wynkyn de
Worde. It is possible that Caxton may have worked
a little in one of the Cologne printing offices, but it seems
clear on internal evidence that Mr. Blades is right in his
conclusion that Caxton did not learn the art there. The
early printed work of Caxton is by no means equal to that
of the Cologne printers, and represents an earlier stage
of development than that which had been reached by
Cologne at this period. Many of the compositor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>methods which were familiar to the Cologne printers of
1470 did not appear in Caxton’s books until years later.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Caxton’s return from Cologne he associated himself
with one Colard Mansion, who for a few years unsuccessfully
attempted to carry on a printing business
at Bruges. The probability is that Caxton learned the
art during this association with Mansion. The association
was terminated in 1476 by the bankruptcy of
Mansion. During this period, however, Caxton and
Mansion published five books, two in English and three
in French. The first to be published, and the first book
to be printed in English anywhere, was the translation
of the Troy stories. One of the other books was the first
book that was ever printed in French. It is interesting
to note that the first book to be printed in French was
done by an Englishman in Flanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1476 Caxton withdrew entirely from his business
connections in Bruges, went to England, taking with
him his presses, type, and workmen, and opened a
printing office within the precincts of Westminster
Abbey. It has often been stated that Caxton’s printing
office was in the abbey building itself, but this is
undoubtedly an error. English abbeys and cathedrals
are commonly surrounded by a considerable extent of
ground called a “close.” Within this “close” are
dwelling houses and not infrequently shops. The entire
property belongs to and is controlled by the abbey
or cathedral authorities. Caxton’s shop appears to
have been in a building known as the “Red Pale”
within the abbey “close.” Caxton continued to print
here until his death in 1491.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within this period he printed ninety-three books
and perhaps eight or ten more whose attribution is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>uncertain. Of these ninety-three, fifteen ran to two
editions and three of the fifteen ran to three editions.
Caxton was a good business man and was
probably possessed of considerable capital when he
began. He not only made the business pay, but took
advantage of his somewhat independent position financially
to lead and create the popular taste instead of
following it. Caxton was thoroughly English. He
knew his people and knew what they would take and
he printed accordingly. He did a good business in
service books, school books, and statutes or public
printing. These were what we should call to-day “pot
boilers” and kept his office going on a sound business
basis. Beyond that he printed a large number of works of
good literature, but he took no unnecessary chances even
in this field. He always endeavored either to get the financial
backing of some wealthy noble or to assure himself of
a reasonable sale before he undertook a new publication.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the field of literature his work was different from
that of almost any other printer of his time. He printed
no Bibles. Latin Bibles could easily be imported from
the continent, probably cheaper than he could print
them. English Bibles were not permitted to be printed
unless the English translation had been made before
the appearance of Wickliffe’s Bible in 1380. There were
translations into English before Wickliffe, as well as a
considerable number of later date, but with the loose
and uncertain dating of manuscripts the printing of an
English Bible was altogether a more risky proposition
than Caxton cared to undertake. He printed no works
on theology. There was no demand for theology in
English, and theology in Latin and Greek could be
cheaply imported. Moreover, although Caxton was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>profoundly religious man and a perfectly loyal son of
the Church, he appears to have had no personal interest
in theology whatever. For similar reasons he printed no
edition of the Fathers and only two volumes of the
classics. He left all of these matters to the importers.</p>

<p class='c007'>His field of publication was the putting before the
public of good, recent literature in the English language.
He did this partly through printing the works
of Chaucer, Langland, and other good English authors
and partly through translation of works in French and
Latin. He was very much interested in English history
and works relating to England, publishing several of
the old chronicles and other matters of this sort. He
believed that there was great help to be found in reading
stories of good women and brave men and he attempted
to lay a store of such stories before his readers.
His own translations cover over five thousand closely
printed folio pages, but he had many other translations
made for him. He was a good linguist in French, Flemish,
and Latin and a tireless worker at his literary and
business labors. He meant that everything which he
printed should be helpful to his readers and should
make for the betterment of the life of his time, although
he would have been the first to disclaim the title of
reformer or missionary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two notable instances of his literary honesty appear.
After the publication of his first edition of Chaucer, an
acquaintance came to him and called his attention to
the fact that he had followed a very imperfect manuscript.
His friend said that his father had a very fine
manuscript and Caxton at once arranged for a loan of
it. Finding that through following an imperfect text
he had omitted many things from Chaucer’s text and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>inserted many others which did not belong there, he
at once printed a correct edition, probably at very
serious loss to himself. The unsold copies of the first
edition became useless and the cost of a second edition
was equal to the first, as the work had to be entirely
done over again from the beginning. The other instance
must be judged by the standards of his time
rather than ours, but showed his desire to present only
correct texts to his readers. Caxton published in 1483
a translation of John Mink’s “Liber Festivalis.” An
independent translation was published at Oxford in
1487. A few years later Caxton published a second
edition, but followed the Oxford text rather than his
own earlier translation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Personally Caxton is a most interesting figure, a
sturdy, honest, high-minded, common-sensible English
gentleman, a man who loved and served God,
honored the King, and helped his neighbor to the best
of his ability, and who did his country an inestimable
service not only by the introduction of a new art but
by the opening of a new field of literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caxton’s printing was not remarkable for typographical
excellence. He used soft type and thin ink, very
much to the detriment of the beauty of his impressions.
The first type which he used was a font of black letter
made in imitation of the handwriting of the Burgundian
clerks of the time. This font had belonged
to Mansion and was probably obtained by Caxton
from Mansion’s creditors. Later he cut for himself
several other fonts, some authorities say five, some
seven. All of his fonts were black-letter Gothic and
all more or less related to the Burgundian script
with which he began. He used / instead of commas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and periods. He had a habit of correcting typographical
errors by hand after the books were finished. He
went over the first copy, making the corrections himself,
and afterward the other copies were made to conform
by clerks or apprentices.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Caxton was at work a few other printers made
their appearance in England. Some time before 1478
Theodoric Rood, of Cologne, opened a printing office at
Oxford. The office was open for about eight years, but
seems to have done only a small business. We have fifteen
books which are known to have come from this press.
They were printed from three different fonts of type.
Two of them were good letters imported from Cologne.
About 1487 Rood disappeared and is supposed to have
gone back to Cologne. In 1479 a press was started at
the abbey of St. Albans. This press published eight
books that we know of, all for church use or the direct
use of the abbey. These books were printed from four
fonts of type, two of which are identical with two of Caxton’s.
It is possible that this was a side enterprise of
Caxton’s, although it is equally possible that the abbey
may have bought the type of Caxton or obtained the
use of his matrices or even hired some type of him.
The conclusions based on apparent identity of type-faces
are always doubtful, as this identity may be accounted
for in a considerable number of ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1480 a printer appeared in London named John
Lettou. Lettou was evidently not an Englishman, but
his origin is unknown. The word Lettou is an old form
of Lithuania. Attempts have been made to identify
him with certain continental printers, but as these
attempts rest on similarities of type-face they are uncertain.
Soon after his appearance Lettou was associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>with William Machlinia or de Machlinia (William
of Mechlin or Malines in Belgium). Machlinia made a
specialty of law books. The business was later taken
over by Richard Pynson. None of these made any
particular contribution to typography. Their interest
lies chiefly in the fact that they were the beginners of
English printing.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no successor to carry on Caxton’s traditions
of scholarship, of literary taste, or even of craftsmanship.
Caxton, as we have said, was a successful
business man before he became a printer and was
doubtless financially independent during the whole of his
later life. His successors were men who were dependent
entirely upon their craft for their livelihood. Caxton’s
immediate successors were two, Wynkyn de Worde, a
native of Lorraine, and Richard Pynson, a native of
Normandy. Both of these men appear to have learned
their trade with Caxton. Wynkyn de Worde carried
on the business after Caxton’s death. De Worde
appears to have been a man of very little education.
Pynson was a graduate of the University of Paris, but
he never became at home in the English language.</p>

<p class='c007'>De Worde carried on the Caxton business from 1491
to 1534, at first in Caxton’s own shop, afterward in
London (Westminster and London have now grown
together, but at that time they were a considerable distance
apart). During this time De Worde published over
six hundred books. His books were cheap and poor in
every way. De Worde was slow to start publishing.
He published almost nothing for a couple of years after
Caxton’s death. He appears to have lacked initiative
and probably lacked capital. He seems to have discovered
that there was money in cheap publications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>a sort that catered to the popular taste, and he diligently
worked that line of business. He appears to
have made money, but cannot be credited with any
higher type of success. He hired translators and editors
and he evidently hired cheap ones, as the editorial
work on his books is not good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pynson printed from 1492 to 1529. He did a much
higher class of work than De Worde, although he is by
no means eminent for his typography. He made less
money than De Worde, but appears to have kept out
of financial difficulties. His publications were mostly
law books. He took over the business of Lettou and
Machlinia, but had specialized in law books on becoming
printer to the king in 1510. Pynson introduced
the use of roman type in 1509, although it was some
time before it displaced the gothic in common use.
In 1523 to 1525 he printed Lord Berners’s translation
of the “Chronicle” of Froissart. In literature this is
a notable event. Froissart was really the first modern
historian. The book marks the transition from the
dry chronicles of the Middle Ages to history proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert Copeland, who began to print about 1514, is
notable as being probably the first English printer, that
is to say, the first native-born Englishman to go into
the business.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the few good printers of this early period was
Thomas Berthelet or Bartlett. Berthelet was a Welshman
and was an excellent bookbinder as well as a good
printer. He was the first man in England to use gold tooling
on his binding. Berthelet enjoyed the position of
royal printer. Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch
were the first printers of English Bibles, which began
to appear about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Regulation of the Industry and the Company of Stationers</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The middle of the sixteenth century marks a distinct
change in English printing. Up to this time
the industry in England had been neither organized,
regulated, nor censored. It had been conducted
under conditions of freedom almost identical with those
which exist to-day, a state of things entirely anomalous
in that period. The quality of English printing in this
period was generally very poor. In spite, however, of
the poor workmanship, there lingers something of the
old craftsman spirit. Although the books show glaring
imperfections, they also show a certain dignity and
harmony which is reminiscent of the spirit of the old
craftsmen. In detail, however, the work was poor both
in composition and presswork. It showed an almost
entire lack of originality. Types, wood-cuts, initials,
ornaments, and even the printer’s devices were not
only bought from the continent of Europe but bought
second-hand and used long after signs of wear had
become painfully evident. Wood-cuts especially were
not only over-used but misused. They were not infrequently
inserted with absolute disregard of the text.
The printers not only stuck in pictures which had no
bearing whatever upon the subject matter, but they
used the same picture more than once in the same book.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reason for this is to be found in the fact that
the proprietors of the large shops were intent on profit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and the proprietors of the small shops had no capital.
The experience of Wynkyn de Worde had shown that
the way to make money was by printing popular books
which could be sold cheap, and his successors learned
the lesson only too rapidly. There was no effective
demand for good printing. The smaller printers had
to buy such materials as they could afford and compete
as best they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>From about 1525, which will be recalled as the date
of the publication of Froissart’s “Chronicle,” there
was a change in the demand for books. The revival
of learning was beginning to make itself felt in England.
The influence of Erasmus on the intellectual
life of the age was very great. This influence was
especially felt in England because Erasmus had himself
spent considerable time there and was a friend of
John Colet, Dean of St. Paul’s, who was not only an
influential clergyman but a very great scholar. England
was also beginning to feel the stirrings of philosophical
and religious discussion. There was a great
demand for educational books to meet the needs of
the scholars and there began to be a great output of
controversial literature. Wynkyn de Worde sometimes
printed three or four editions of the same Latin grammar
in one year, so great was the demand for educational
books.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the middle of the century, however, very
little original work was printed in England, or at any
rate is now extant. The popular demand was for reprints
of old books and for translations of French poems
and romances. The classics and other works of more
serious literature were commonly imported. There was
also a considerable amount of printing for the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>trade done on the continent. Not content with furnishing
the English with books in Greek and Latin and
the modern languages, some of the continental printers
did a flourishing trade in the printing of books in English.
Their work was generally better and cheaper than
that of the English printers.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has already been said, English printing was left
very much alone up to 1557 excepting that privileges
were granted by the crown rather freely. Beginning
with the privileges to print statutes and law books, the
practice spread until by the middle of the sixteenth century
practically all profitable printing was covered by
privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period, and indeed for several centuries
later, the industry was free from labor troubles. The
reason, however, is to be found in the peculiar situation
which existed under English law. Under English
common law all combinations of workmen were considered
as contrary to public policy, regarded as combinations
in restraint of trade, and dealt with very
harshly. A single workman might work or refuse to
work for whatever pay or under whatever conditions
he pleased, but an agreement of two or more on this
basis, that is to combine for pay, hours, and the like,
was a criminal conspiracy. Not only were any agreements
such a group of men might make absolutely
void, but the very fact of entering such a combination
was itself a criminal offence. From the reign of Edward
I (1272–1307) to George IV (1820–1830) thirty or
forty acts of Parliament, commonly called “Statutes
of Laborers,” were passed on this basis. The reënactment
of legislation on this subject from time to time
was not caused, as is usual in such cases, by the ineffectiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of the legislation but by the necessity of
meeting special conditions which were created by visitations
of the plague, wars, and other events having
far-reaching industrial effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The development of the factory system of production,
beginning about the middle of the eighteenth century,
with the consequent gathering of great groups of
workmen in certain localities and the rapid increase in
the town population, rendered a continuance of the old
regulations more and more difficult. The laws against
combinations of workmen were evaded by the organization
of secret societies, while the displacement of
large numbers of hand workers by the introduction of
machinery caused serious labor troubles and rioting.
Other conditions too familiar to need description arose
which caused friction between the workmen and their
employers. Attempts were made at first to put a stop
to the combinations of the workmen by more and more
stringent legislation. This proving unsuccessful, the
legislation was modified in the direction of leniency.
Gradually the unions won their way to recognition,
although this recognition was developed in the slow
and inconsistent way which is common with English
legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1875 the whole matter was put on a new basis by
the legal acceptance of the principle that it is lawful
for any combination of men to do any act which it
would be lawful for either of them to do singly. This,
of course, was a reversal of the fundamental principle
of more than six hundred years of labor legislation, that
it was not lawful for a combination of men to do things
which any one of them might lawfully do. Since that
time the unions have rapidly won their way to full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>recognition and to great importance in the industry. In
England to-day practically all trades are very thoroughly
unionized. The printing industry is no exception.
Union membership is much more universal among the
workmen in the industry than it is in the United States.
This development of organization among the workmen
has been accompanied by a development of strong
organizations of employers in all industries. To-day
practically all industrial bargaining in England is collective
bargaining carried on between associated employers
and associated employees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same difficulties arising out of lack of regulation
which had vexed the industry on the continent
had made themselves felt in England, but with their
usual good sense the English attacked the problem at
a very early period. Nearly sixty years before the
organization of the Community of Printers in France,
in 1618, the English had put printing in line with the
other industries by the organization of the Stationers’
Company in 1557, the last year of Queen Mary I.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the Stationers was by no means
an innovation. It was rather the legalizing and regularizing
of a condition which had risen under the familiar
conditions of English industry. As early as 1403
we find the guild or fraternity of scriveners. This
guild or fraternity developed into the “Craft” of stationers,
influential in fixing and controlling trade customs.
The growth of the craft or trade guilds in England
was not unlike that of similar organizations in
Europe. Their control of the situation, however, seems
to have been even more close than elsewhere. An ordinance
of Edward II (1307–1327) compelled every citizen
of a town to be a member of some craft or mystery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>In 1375 the election of the city officials of London
was turned over to the craft guilds or, as they were
termed, liveried companies. The liveried companies
were so called because each had a distinctive dress
which was worn on formal occasions. From this time
on the liveried companies controlled the political and
municipal power of London for several centuries, electing
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, controlling the
train-bands, or city militia, and to a great extent holding
the defence of the kingdom in their hands. About
seventy-six of these companies still continue to exist.
They survive mainly for charitable and philanthropic
purposes, conserving and administering the large funds
which were accumulated in early centuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Stationers’ Company was organized in 1557
partly because the printers saw the necessity for organization
and regulation of the industry, and partly because
the crown desired a better means for controlling
printing than had theretofore existed. It will be remembered
that this was in the midst of the age of
religious controversy. King Henry VIII had attempted
to set himself up as the head of a national church which
was not Protestant and at the same time did not
acknowledge allegiance to the Pope. King Henry executed
with great impartiality both those who defended
the ecclesiastical supremacy of the Pope and those
who professed Protestant opinions. His successor,
King Edward VI, was a Protestant and attempted to
make England Protestant. His short reign was followed
by that of Mary I, who was a Catholic and attempted
to make England Catholic. Her comparatively
short reign was followed by the long reign of Elizabeth,
in whose time Protestantism became the established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>state church of England. It will be remembered that
it was near the close of Mary’s reign that the Stationers’
Company was chartered, and the interest of
the crown in securing a better control of the printing
press and its output is obvious. In 1560, the second
year of Elizabeth, the incorporation of the Stationers’
Company was rendered complete by the enrolment
of the new company in the list of the liveried companies
of London, and we shall presently see that the royal
hand was laid heavily upon the printers and their work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Stationers’ Company was organized in the usual
form, with its administration in the hands of a Master
and two Wardens. The terms of the charter gave the
company authority to govern the trade and to enforce
its regulations by the exercise of the right of visitation
and disciplinary control over its members. This
extended not only to the enforcement of the regulations
of the Company but also to the enforcement of
royal proclamations and injunctions, and decrees of
the Star Chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Star Chamber, frequently mentioned in English
history in general, as well as in the history of English
printing, was a special court of high officials. The
powers and jurisdiction of this court were somewhat
vague and undefined. Theoretically it was intended
to deal with matters which could not be adequately
dealt with by the regular courts because of the necessity
of immediate action, the important nature of the
case, or other conditions which made the action of the
ordinary courts too slow or not sufficiently effective.
Naturally the existence of such a court opened the
way to serious abuses, and alleged abuses of its authority
played a very large part in the Revolution by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>King Charles I lost his head. As a result of these revolutionary
movements, the court was discontinued in
1641, after an existence of at least three hundred years.
It is supposed to have derived its name from the fact
that the ceiling of the room it sat in in early times was
decorated with stars.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the organization of the Stationers’ Company
the exercise of the trade was limited to its members.
The Company was required to keep registers giving
the names of the Masters and Wardens, of all the members
of the Company and their apprentices, and of all
who “took up freedom,” that is to say, became members
of the Company from time to time. All books
printed were required to be registered with the Company
and a copy deposited in the archives accompanied
by a fee. This was the beginning of copyright. It was
understood that the members of the Company should
respect each others’ rights to publications thus registered,
although it appears to have been a “gentleman’s
agreement” rather than a regulation. This requirement
did not apply to books which were published
under royal privilege, but the members of the Company
were bound to respect these privileges and not
in any way infringe upon the rights which they conferred.
The requirement of registration did not apply
to the king’s printers in so far as their patent for the
royal printing extended; that is to say, the royal printer
was not required to register statutes, law books, or other
government printing, but he was required to register
all general publications. This legislation requiring
registration was not always strictly enforced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The powers of the Company were used much more
for the regulation and control of printing than for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>improvement of the art. It was to the Company that
the government looked particularly for the enforcement
of the statutes regarding printing. For that
reason, if a book were of doubtful character and liable
to be prohibited the publisher preferred to run the
chance of attempting to evade the regulation regarding
registration. Fortunately the registers of the Company
containing the records of all their transactions
are for the most part still in existence. They furnish
an immense fund of valuable information extending
over a very long period.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Stationers’ Company included the printers, bookbinders,
type-founders, and booksellers. It had ninety-seven
charter members. A few of the London printers
are known not to have joined the Company when it was
organized. Why they stood out we do not know. Very
likely it was simply the usual assertion of British independence
and impatience of control. The requirement
of membership in the Company as a requisite to carrying
on the business was not enforced with regard to
those printers who were in business when the Company
was chartered, its application being restricted to those
who might thereafter desire to enter the business. Some
of the independents afterwards joined the Company.
The remainder stayed out permanently.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the Company was not in itself
sufficient to secure the desired control of the industry.
As has already been pointed out, an immense flood of
printed matter was being brought out on account of
the bitter religious and political controversies of the
time. Most of it was very poor printing. The end
desired was to get it out as quickly as possible and as
cheaply as possible. Much of it was objectionable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the government and the organization of the Company
was immediately followed up by repressive legislation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1558 Queen Elizabeth laid the foundation of legislation
for the control of the press by issuing “injunctions”
which required that every book should be licensed
either by the Queen or by the members of the
Privy Council, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, by
the Chancellor of one of the two universities, or by
other authorities specified in the act. Frequent proclamations
and orders show that the injunctions were
not obeyed. It may be laid down as a fundamental
principle in the study of history that the frequent repetition
of legislation on any one subject shows that the
subject is considered very important by the government
and that the legislation is not effective. So seriously
was this matter regarded by the government
that very extreme measures were adopted in dealing
with offending printers. One William Carter, for
instance, who had been several times punished for
breach of the printing regulations, finally printed a
seditious book, “a treatise of schisme,” for which he
was tried for high treason, condemned to death and
hanged, disembowelled, and quartered according to the
ghastly custom of that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>By way of further tightening of the regulations a
Star Chamber decree was issued in 1586 much more
strict than any preceding order. By the provisions of
this decree all presses then working had to be reported
in the same way as already provided. No presses
whatever were allowed outside of London, excepting
one each at Oxford and Cambridge. Previous to the
charter of the Company provincial presses had been
started at Oxford, York, Cambridge, Abingdon, Tavistock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>St. Albans, Bristol, Ipswich, Canterbury, and
Norwich, in the order named. These, of course, were
all swept away by this act excepting those of Oxford
and Cambridge. No more presses were to be permitted
until the number in use had been reduced to a number
which should be pronounced sufficient for the needs of
the kingdom by the Archbishop of Canterbury and
the Bishop of London. Vacancies in the number of
licensed printers were to be filled by three stationers
(members of the Company) who would be nominated
by the Company and licensed by an ecclesiastical commission.
The censorship, both ecclesiastical and lay,
was developed and enforced by further provisions of
the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the conditions under which that great
literature which is known as Elizabethan literature
was created and published. It seems incredible that
such literature could have been produced under such
conditions. The fact that it was so produced seems
to show that the censors made a conscientious attempt
to enforce the legislation in such a way as to prevent
the actual abuse of the printing press and to protect
the government from danger arising from these sources,
while leaving pure literature as free as the conditions
permitted. Of course, we of to-day regard any system
of press censorship as wrong and cannot approve
any such legislation. It is worth while, however, to
remember that these men made an earnest effort to
live up to the moral and political standards of their
own time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the execution of this edict the Stationers’ Company
made weekly official visits to every shop. These
visitations were intended to ascertain:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>1. How many presses each printer possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. What he printed.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. How many impressions were taken of each piece
of work.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. How many workmen and apprentices there were
in each plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Whether unauthorized persons were employed or
allowed to remain about the plant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The regulations of the edict and also the private
regulations of the Company seem to have been enforced
at this time with all the thoroughness in the
power of the Company. The registers show that its
officers frequently seized and destroyed editions of
unlicensed books and in other ways enforced the edicts
against all persons. Its own members were frequently
disciplined. The registers show discipline for printing
an unlicensed book, for selling a prayer book of Edward
VI in place of one of Elizabeth, for infringing a copyright,
for printing indecent or offensive matters, for
selling books to other than book-shops, for selling books
“disorderly printed,” for keeping open on Sundays
and festival days, and for keeping unregistered apprentices.
The phrase “disorderly printed” appears to
refer to the careless and inaccurate printing of the books
rather than to the nature of their contents. The printing
standards of the time were not high, but this would
appear to indicate a disposition to maintain them,
such as they were. The punishment for selling to other
than book shops is interesting as showing that at that
early period the book trade suffered from one of the
things which to-day causes much complaint among
booksellers. Sales by department stores, drug stores,
and other parties disposed to cut rates are regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>serious difficulties in the book trade of to-day and it is
evident that the same difficulty occurred three hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulties of the printers were by no means
limited to those created by the edicts or regulations.
One of the great sources of difficulty lay in the privileges
and monopolies which had been recklessly granted
for a considerable period. These privileges had a most
unfortunate effect upon the industry both on the side
of business and on that of craftsmanship. On the side
of business they gave to certain printers a monopoly
of practically all of the work which was certain to produce
good financial returns, leaving to the unprivileged
printers the doubtful enterprise of producing current
literature. On the side of craftsmanship they took
away the spur of competition. The greater part of
the literature of this period was produced by unprivileged
printers, most of it with very little profit to them.
On the other hand, the privileged printer, being secured
in his monopoly of a certain kind of production, was
not held to any artistic standards. Competition being
impossible, he could print as cheaply and as badly as
he chose and generally did so. In both directions the
effect was paralyzing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally the unprivileged printers were constantly
tempted to infringe upon the monopoly rights of the
others, with the result that there was constant friction
and appeals to authority were taken on both sides.
The matter finally came to a head in a serious revolt
of the unprivileged printers under the leadership of
one John Wolfe. Wolfe was a member of the Fishmongers’
Company, but had undertaken to do printing
and declared boldly that he proposed to lead a movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>which would revolutionize the entire situation.
The revolt was sufficiently serious to bring about a
compromise by which a considerable number of privileges
were given up entirely or turned over to the
Company to be re-distributed by them among the
printers. The extent to which these privileges were
granted may be seen by the fact that John Day, of
whom we shall hear more presently, alone gave up fifty-three
privileges, although he kept several of the most
important and profitable ones. Wolfe transferred his
membership from the Fishmongers’ to the Stationers’
Company. As a member of the Stationers’ Company
he obtained certain privileges for himself and it is interesting
to note that not long afterward the registers of
the Company show Wolfe appealing because somebody
had infringed upon a privilege of his. Wolfe rose to
become an officer of the Company and distinguished
himself as a prosecutor of offending printers and a
staunch upholder of law and order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural result of the reduction of the number
of offices under the edict of 1586 was that the trade
was seriously overmanned and there were too many
apprentices, as the reduction in the number of offices
did not affect the number of either journeymen or
apprentices. The Company dealt with the matter in
a rather successful fashion by an order issued in 1587.
This order limited the number of apprentices and
attempted to make as much work as possible for the
journeymen. It provided that no apprentice should
be allowed to work in either the composing room or
the press room if there were any competent journeymen
in need of work. When we remember the small
number of offices in London and the fact that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>were only two in England outside of London, we can
readily see that this order was not so difficult of enforcement
as might appear. No form was to be kept
standing to the injury of workmen. The meaning of
this is clearer when we remember that all composition
at this time was hand composition and that stereotyping
and other methods of preserving forms were not known
and consequently a reprint or re-issue was, excepting
for absence of editorial work, a new job. If there was
expectation that a new reprint might soon be required
and the printer had the type to spare he might leave
a form standing and so avoid the labor of recomposition.
This regulation meant that as soon as the first
impression was taken the type must be distributed so
that in case of reprinting the compositor would have
a new job. For like reasons the number of copies to
be printed was limited in ordinary cases to 1250 or
1500, so that if the book proved to be popular work
might be provided in setting up repeated editions.
These regulations seem to have been reasonably successful
so far as the journeymen were concerned, but,
of course, they materially increased the price of books.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period of apprenticeship was from seven to
eleven years. It was intended that apprenticeship
should end at 24, and the length of the apprenticeship
depended upon the age at which it was begun. At the
end of the apprenticeship the indenture required that
the master should make the apprentice free of the Company
“if he have well and truely served.” As the limit
of membership of the Company was only about 25,
for a long period only about one-half of the apprentices
ever became masters; the rest of them remained permanently
in the position of journeymen. As elsewhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>in Europe, the apprentice might become heir to the
business and the place in the Company by marrying
either the daughter or the widow of a master printer.
Apparently the business went to the widow rather
than to the daughter if the widow survived. Widows
even seem to have taken the business in preference to
sons. Consequently the widow of a master printer was
a very desirable match for an ambitious apprentice in
spite of any difference in age, and several instances
are recorded where a business changed hands twice by
successive re-marriages of the widow.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a strong tendency, which we shall discuss
more at length later, for the bookseller to get control
of the situation. Copyrights generally belonged to
the booksellers. They purchased them from the authors
and held them as against the printers. It must be
remembered that an author could not obtain a copyright,
as copyright was secured by registration in the
Stationers’ Company and this registration could be
made only by a bookseller or a printer. Consequently
the author was obliged to content himself with what
the purchaser of his work was willing to give him. The
bookseller naturally got his printing done as cheaply
as he could and printers cut prices then just as they
do now, and got poor as a result, just as they do now.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>John Day and the Dark Ages of English Printing</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One name stands out among English printers of
this period, that of John Day, who has been described
as “one of the best and most enterprising of
printers.” Day was born in 1522 and began to print in
1546. His business career lasted for thirty-eight years.
He died in 1584, at the age of 62. Day began his business
life at a period when English printing was very poor. His
first books were as bad as those of his contemporaries.
They were printed from worn type, the presswork was
bad, they were without pagination, and he did not even
use a device such as was customary among printers
at that time. His first important work was a Bible,
printed in 1549. This Bible was illustrated by wood-cuts
which were very evidently second-hand, as they
extended beyond the letter-press on the page. On the
accession of Queen Mary I, in 1553, he went abroad,
possibly for religious reasons, but probably not, as Day,
like most printers of this particular time, found no
difficulty in conforming himself to the religious views
of the government. As a rule they accepted the peculiar
position of Henry VIII which has already been
described, printed Protestant books under Edward VI,
Catholic books under Mary, and Protestant books
under Elizabeth. They seem to have been quite content,
in other words, to take what was brought them
and to accept whatever government regulations might
be in existence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>This attitude on the part of the printers reflects the
general attitude of the English people at this time.
There is very little doubt that the mass of the people
were neither staunchly Catholic nor aggressively Protestant.
While there were earnest and aggressive
spirits in both parties, it seems quite clear that the
vast majority of the people were ready to accept either
Catholicism or Protestantism as a state church. England
did not become aggressively Protestant until well
into the reign of Elizabeth. Unfortunately for the
interests of religion and of religious toleration, the
church question became a political question, and when
Spain and the other Catholic powers attempted to
overthrow the government of England and make England
dependent upon Spain, patriotism and Protestantism
came to be regarded by the English as synonymous
terms. Here, as elsewhere, the Reformation was
a political more than a religious question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just when Day returned to England is not clear,
but it was before the death of Queen Mary, as he was
a charter member of the Stationers’ Company, which
was chartered in the last year of her reign, and published
a book dated the same year. Evidently Day
studied abroad. Very probably that was his purpose
in travel, for we find that in 1559 his books began to
show excellence and they improved in quality until we
find him soon producing the best printing which had
yet been done in England. From this time on his
work was marked by accuracy, taste, and a high grade
of excellence in both typography and presswork.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was greatly encouraged and at times assisted by
Matthew Parker, who was Archbishop of Canterbury
from 1559 to 1575. Parker was by no means a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>man, but he was just the sort of man whom the autocratic
Elizabeth wished to have for Archbishop of
Canterbury. He was moderate in his views and easygoing
in temperament, a scholar and collector of beautiful
things and a patron of the arts and sciences.
Parker not only encouraged and patronized Day but
employed him to print on the private press which the
Archbishop had set up at Lambeth. Day’s best piece
of work was an edition of Asser’s “Life of Alfred the
Great” which he printed for Parker in 1574.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day published and printed the first edition of Foxe’s
“Book of Martyrs,” a huge folio volume of 2008 pages.
In 1578 Day published a book in Latin and Greek.
The Greek was the best face yet seen in England and
was equal to the work of Estienne. Other notable
achievements of Day were the printing of the Psalter
with musical notes, the cutting of Hebrew words
in wood to be used in printing the life of Bishop Jewel,
published in 1573, and the cutting of a font of Saxon
type which appears to have been the first used in England.
This font contained twenty-six capitals and
twenty-seven lowercase letters. The capitals consisted
of eighteen old roman letters and eight Saxon characters,
two of which were diphthongs. The lowercase contained
fifteen roman and twelve Saxon characters. Day also
cut italic types to match roman, the first time this had
been done. Day’s work was mainly religious, although
he published some of the first English plays and some
other works of general literature.</p>

<p class='c007'>As usual with men of great excellence, Day suffered
much from the antagonism of jealous rivals, but this
antagonism was not sufficient to deprive him of success.
The excellence of his work was rewarded not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>only by success in business but by the award of a large
number of privileges which were sources of great profit.
We have seen, however, that he relinquished a large
number of these at the time of Wolfe’s revolt. Those
that he saved seem to have been by far the most
profitable.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few other printers of this period need mention
for various reasons. The best work after that of Day
was done by Vautrollier. Tottell, whose name is variously
spelled in the records of the time, printed many
things of great value to English literature. He was
an enterprising printer of contemporary publications.
Robert Darker, king’s printer to James I, printed the
statutes, proclamations, and editions of the Book of
Common Prayer of that period and deserves to be
remembered as the original printer of the so-called
Authorized Version of the Bible, published in 1611.
This English text, sometimes called the Authorized
and sometimes called the King James Version, was the
only text of the English Bible received among English-speaking
people until the revision made in the latter part
of the eighteenth century. It may be worth while to
note that this version is not uncommonly erroneously
referred to as the St. James Version. There is absolutely
no justification for this common error. The
book was authorized by King James and for that reason
is known as the Authorized or King James Version.
King James, however, was no saint. The authorization
was simply a license or permission. Darker
published the book as a commercial venture at his
own expense. He used the same type and the same
ornaments as those used in the Bishop’s Bible, an
English translation published in 1568.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>John Norton, another one of the group of printers
favored by James I, cut some of the best Greek types
which have ever appeared in England. He was a
worthy successor in this field of John Day. William
and Isaac Jaggard printed the famous folio edition
of Shakespeare’s plays in 1623. Typographically it
was a poor piece of work, but as a literary landmark
it is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The standards of Day were not long maintained.
There were a few good printers in the seventeenth century,
but for the most part they were poor and the tendency
was decidedly toward deterioration. Political and
religious controversies broke out afresh in the reign of
James I (1613–1625) and were continued with increasing
bitterness until they finally broke into the storm
of civil war which swept over England in the reign of
Charles I. A natural result of these conditions was a
tightening of the restrictions upon the press, which
became more and more burdensome. The controversies
called forth floods of literature, much of which
had to be clandestinely printed. The restrictions, as
we shall presently see, were almost unbearable and
the market was greatly disturbed. The consequence
was that English printing reached its low-water mark
in the last half of the seventeenth century. The period
which we are considering, however, shows one important
invention which in its field was a distinct improvement.
Copperplate engraving was introduced into
England in 1540, but it was a long time before it came
into general use. Later we find it used first for portraits,
then for engraved title pages, some of which
were of great beauty, and then for general purposes of
illustration.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>James I strengthened the Company of Stationers
by withdrawing several valuable privileges from private
persons and giving them to the Company. This
action was probably taken with a view to making the
Company more reliable as the agent for the enforcement
of the press laws, which were not materially
changed during James’s reign. With the political and
religious dissensions which followed the accession of
Charles I in 1525 came renewed efforts to meet the
rising tides of discussion and to dam up the flood of
pamphlets, mostly badly printed, first by the more
stringent enforcement of the old laws and then by the
enactment of new ones. The Company’s registers at
this time show a long list of penalties, including fines,
cropping of ears, imprisonment, and expulsion from
the Company. It is only just to King Charles, however,
to say that he did attempt to foster learning
and encourage good printing, provided the learning
were politically and religiously orthodox according to
King Charles’s standards and the printers were amenable
to authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection there is a rather interesting incident
of an attempt by King Charles to set up a Greek
press. In 1631 Barker and Lucas printed the so-called
“Wicked Bible,” which derived its name from
an unfortunate typographical error, the omission of
the word “not” in the seventh commandment. Barker
and Lucas were fined for their carelessness £300, a
very heavy fine, equal, if we make allowance for the
difference in the purchasing power of money, to about
$12,000 to-day. In settlement of this fine they were
commanded instead of paying the money into the
treasury to purchase £300 worth of Greek type and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>to print one Greek book a year at their own cost and
risk, the Archbishop of Canterbury to fix the size of
the edition. They gladly agreed to this, but owing
to the political conditions which immediately followed
very little came of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1637 a Star Chamber decree was issued which
marks the high-water mark of governmental regulations
in England. By this decree all books of every
sort were to be licensed. Law books were to be licensed
by the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chief Baron;
books dealing with history by the Secretaries of State;
books on heraldry by the Earl Marshal; books on any
other subjects by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Bishop of London, or the Chancellors or Vice-Chancellors
of the two universities. Two copies of every
book submitted for publication were to be handed to
the licenser, one of which he was to keep for future
reference. Catalogues of books imported into the country
were to be sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury
or to the Bishop of London, and no consignments of
foreign books were to be opened until the representatives
of one of these dignitaries and of the Stationers’
Company were present.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was further decreed that no merchant or bookseller
should import from abroad any book printed
in the English language. The main purpose of this
enactment was probably to prevent evasion of the
English press laws by the importation from abroad
of books objectionable to the government. It was
also, although this purpose was probably secondary,
intended to protect England from foreign competition.
The name of the printer, the author, and the publisher,
and the place of publication and sale were to be placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>in every book. No person was permitted to erect a
printing press or to let any premises for the purpose
of carrying on printing without first giving notice to
the Company, and no carpenter was permitted to make
a press without similar notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of master printers was limited to twenty.
Every master printer had to give a bond of £300 for
good behavior. The Master and the Wardens of
the Stationers’ Company might have three presses each
and three apprentices. No other printer could have
more than two presses. A master printer on the livery
(a member of the Company) might have two apprentices,
others only one. The master printers were to
give work to journeymen when requested to do so.
This enactment was not made out of any tenderness
for unemployed journeymen but for the reason that
the unemployed journeyman was always tempted to
pick up an occasional shilling by printing unlicensed
or objectionable books. It was considered desirable
to keep him employed where his work could be supervised.
All reprints had to be licensed exactly the same
as new publications. The Company was confirmed
in its right of search. This meant not simply a right
of supervision of printing offices, but the right to search
any place where it might be suspected that printing
was being carried on. One copy of every book had to
be filed in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Only four
type-founders were permitted to carry on business.
Books could be sold only by booksellers. The punishments
imposed for infractions of these laws included
destruction of stock, fines, imprisonment, and whipping
at the cart’s tail. The allowance of type-founders,
small as it was, seemed to be ample, in spite of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>fact that English type-founders had now ceased to cut
type. English type-founding had generally been poor
up to this time and was to continue so for some time
to come. What new type came into use in the English
printing offices was mainly bought on the continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time a great deal of printing had been
done on the continent for the English market. The
works of the Fathers, the classics, and the greater
part of the serious publications of the time, being
printed mostly in Latin, were in the hands of the
continental printers. With their facilities for the
production and distribution of books they held the
market so securely that English printers did not even
attempt competition. In addition to that a great
deal of printing in the English language for the English
market continued to be done on the continent.
As has already been indicated, a good deal of this was
political and religious and could not safely be published
in England. A considerable quantity of it, however,
was work in general literature, which was done
better than most English work and cheaper than English
work of a corresponding quality. The act of 1637
shut off a great deal of this foreign printing, especially
so much of it as was controversial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further legislation was enacted in order to develop
English printing. For a long time printing was not
an English industry. It will be remembered that
although Caxton was English born most of the early
printing was done by foreigners who came to England
for that purpose, and for a long time there was a very
large foreign element in the industry. In 1523 a law
was passed that no alien engaged in the printing business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in England could take any but English-born apprentices.
In 1529 an act was passed that no alien
not already naturalized could set up any house or
shop for the exercise of any handicraft in England.
In 1534 it was further enacted that no books should
be imported bound and ready for sale and that no
unnaturalized alien could sell foreign printed books
except at wholesale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decree of 1637 was fortunately not long-lived.
The political ascendency of Parliament soon began to
be felt and in 1641 the Star Chamber was abolished.
While the abolition of this court did not directly affect
the decree of 1637, indirectly it made it practically
void. For a short while Parliament permitted the
decree to lapse and left the printers very much to themselves.
This was not because Parliament was any
more liberal than King Charles in its views on the
subject of printing. It was only that while Parliament
was strong enough to suffer the law to be evaded and
so to give free rein to the scribbling propensities of
its supporters, it was not yet strong enough to muzzle
the writers on the other side. Parliament was also very
busy with other concerns and for the time being was
content to let the printers alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was an enormous flood of printing, most
of it worse than ever. An examination of the publications
of the time shows that everything that would
go on a press was dug up and utilized. We find in use
old type and blocks which had formed part of the
stock of Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson. As soon,
however, as Parliament got well seated in power it
proceeded to deal with printers along the old lines.
In 1643 it reënacted the decree of 1637 with the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>modification that the number of printers was not
limited. In 1649 sixty printers in London and the two
university towns gave the bonds for good conduct
required by law as a requisite to carrying on the business.
It will be remembered that the decree of 1637
limited the number in London to twenty, with one in
each of the universities. This act called forth one of
the noblest pieces of literature in the English language,
Milton’s “Areopagitica,” or plea for unlicensed printing,
in which Milton brings all the resources of his great
learning and matchless literary skill to the defence
of the freedom of the press. The plea, of course, fell
on deaf ears for the time, but it remains one of the
jewels of English literature. The Parliamentary government
held the act as a weapon which could be used
in case of need. It was strictly enforced with regard
to political and religious books and newspapers. It
seems to have been very little enforced outside these
limits.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Cromwell took the reins of power as Lord
Protector of England he enforced the press laws very
strictly. Cromwell was a masterful man and was not
disposed to permit criticism of his person and government
or discussion of matters of public policy upon
which the government had decided. On the death
of Cromwell there followed a period of political uncertainty
during which the enforcement of the act was
relaxed, only to be renewed at the accession of King
Charles II in 1660.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the accession of King Charles a group
of the best printers unsuccessfully petitioned for the
incorporation of a Company of Printers as distinguished
from the Stationers. They alleged that the Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of Stationers was controlled by the booksellers and
that they cheapened printing and impoverished the
printers, that the Company of Stationers was so large
that only old men could attain to the dignity of masters
or wardens, and that only once in ten or twelve years
was it possible for a journeyman printer to become a
master printer. They claimed that a new Company
would free the printing industry from these shackles,
that it would improve the quality of printing, and
that it would secure for the government better supervision
of the output of the press. This last was probably
a bait to the hook. The petition was not granted,
however, and things went on in the old fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1662 a new act similar to the preceding ones was
passed, containing only one important variation by
which the privilege of having a printing press was
extended to the city of York. This act was for a time
very strictly enforced. The police power necessary
to the enforcement of the act was taken away from
the Stationers’ Company and entrusted to Sir Roger
Lestrange, who was appointed censor of the press.
He was given control of the printing office and power
of search. With a few reserved exceptions the entire
licensing of books was placed in his hands and he was
given a monopoly of the publication of news. Sir
Roger seems to have taken himself quite seriously
and to have discharged his functions for some years
with a considerable degree of efficiency. Many books,
however, were published without licenses. Some were
published clandestinely, while it is probable that Sir
Roger was more concerned to exercise the powers of
office for the suppression of political and religious
controversy and for the protection of his monopoly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>than for the control of pure literature. The act was
reënacted in 1685 for a period of seven years. It was
then reënacted for a period of one year and finally
disappeared in 1694.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the wretched condition of printing at
this period a few lights appear in the gloom. Thomas
Roycroft did some very excellent printing. He achieved
one of the most remarkable tasks which had yet
been accomplished by an English printer in the publication
of his famous Polyglot Bible. This Bible gave
the text in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Chaldean, Syriac,
Arabic, Samaritan, Persian, and Ethiopic. Of course,
these languages did not all appear in all parts of the
Bible. The Greek, Latin, and Arabic texts appear
throughout. The Hebrew and Chaldean appear in the
Old Testament, the Ethiopic in the Psalms and New
Testament only, and the Persian only in the New
Testament. The types used came from four foundries,
one of them being a face cut by John Day. The work
was published in six great volumes, pages 16 x 10 inches.
The text was so arranged that when the Bible was
opened at any point each double page showed all the
languages used for that particular passage. The first
volume was published in September of 1654. The
second appeared in 1655, the third in 1656, and the
other three in 1657. Cromwell encouraged the work
by ordering the admission of the paper duty free.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1688 the largest office in London was that of
James Fletcher, who had five presses and employed
thirteen journeymen and two apprentices. One of the
printers of this period, John Barber, arrived at the distinction
of Lord Mayor of London. He was a very
popular Lord Mayor and he must have been very prosperous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>in business or he would not have acquired the
means necessary to holding the position. He was in no
way remarkable as a printer, however.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period there were four type-founders of
importance—Joseph Moxon, the Andrews brothers,
the Glover brothers, and Thomas James. The most
famous of these was James Moxon. Primarily a man of
science, he was distinguished as a mathematician and
hydrographer. To these interests he added type-founding.
Like Dürer in Germany and Geoffry Tory
in France, he worked out a theory of type design in
exact mathematical proportions, but like these and
other attempts of the same sort it was not successful.
While it is true that there must be proportion in type-faces,
it is also true that a beautiful and legible type-face
must have qualities other than a mere mathematical
exactness. Moxon is known chiefly by his
important work, “Mechanick Exercises.” Part II of
this book is an exhaustive study of printing and type-founding.
So thorough was Moxon’s study of these subjects
and so accurate his presentation that the work is
yet a standard authority on many fundamental points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joseph and Robert Andrews, although not very good
workmen, made an extensive variety of type and found
a good sale for it. They used the Moxon fonts, but
added to them new roman and italic fonts, learned
fonts, so called, Anglo-Saxon, and Irish. James and
Thomas Glover cast two fonts of black letter from the
matrices cut by Wynkyn de Worde and some foreign
letters. They do not appear to have undertaken competition
with Andrews and James in the ordinary forms
of letter. Thomas James, who shared with the Andrews
brothers a large portion of the business, used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>two sets of matrices cut in Holland. Of course, these
few type-founders hardly made a beginning of supplying
the English printers with type. The greater part
of the printing of this period was done from type imported
from Holland. It was in order to compete with
this imported type that James obtained possession
of the two fonts of Dutch matrices which were the
backbone of his type-foundry.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Restoration of 1660, we find the Oxford
Press rapidly advancing to the commanding position
in English printing which it came to occupy in later
years and still holds. Oxford had been a centre of
royal influence in the civil wars. King Charles I held
court there for some time and the university was
always staunchly loyal to the Stuarts. Naturally it
enjoyed the sunshine of royal favor when the Stuarts
came back in the person of Charles II.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1667 Dr. John Fell, Vice-Chancellor of the University
and afterward Bishop of Oxford, gave the
University a complete type-foundry with matrices of
roman, italic, black-letter Saxon, and several Oriental
tongues. Ten years later Francis Junius added
to the equipment of the foundry a splendid collection
of out-of-the-way types, including Runic, Gothic, Saxon,
Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish, together with a considerable
number of types of the more common sorts.
This equipment of type for learned work and foreign
language printing enabled the Oxford Press to take a
position without a rival as a producer of learned literature.
The presswork and composition done at
Oxford were well maintained on the level of their type
equipment, so that the Oxford University Press soon
came to hold a unique position.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Eighteenth Century: the Period of Transition</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The eighteenth century was a very important time
in the history of English printing. It was the
period of the changes and inventions which led over
from the mediævalism of the seventeenth century
to the modernism of the nineteenth. Three special
changes took place: first, the invention of stereotyping;
second, the rise of the modern publisher; and, third, the
dawn of modern ideas in types and typography.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of the invention of stereotyping is the
tale only too common in industry of the inventor who
is ahead of his time, the selfish and thoughtless crowd
who opposed him, the apparent failure of the enterprise,
and final success for the idea when the inventor
is no longer alive to enjoy his triumph. About 1720
it occurred to a Scotchman named Ged that it ought
not to be difficult to cast type by the page. He hit
upon the idea of making a plaster-of-paris mould of the
type-set page and from it casting the plates. As usual
in such cases, he needed a partner with capital and
some technical knowledge. In 1727 he associated
himself with an Edinburgh printer, who soon became
alarmed at the apparent prospective cost and withdrew
from the enterprise. Soon after this Ged got
acquainted with a London stationer named William
Fenner. Fenner in turn introduced him to Thomas
James, the type-founder, and the three associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>themselves in partnership for the development of the
new process. For some reason James proved treacherous.
Apparently the investment which he was making
should have served to keep him faithful. Whether
he became alarmed by a fancied danger to his business
or was frightened or bought off by the printers is not
clear. At any rate, his cooperation was only halfhearted.
Instead of furnishing Ged with the best of
type from which to make his moulds he furnished him
with very poor type and his workmen wilfully damaged
the forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this was going on Ged was appointed printer
to the University of Cambridge, where he met with
the same experiences at the hands of the printers.
Under great difficulties and discouragements he succeeded
in producing two prayer books which were
printed from his plates, but the animosity of the printers
was so violent that the authorities suppressed the
books and destroyed the plates. The reason for this
animosity is not far to seek. The journeymen had
not yet recovered from the fear and danger caused by
the old statutes which had limited the number of shops
without limiting the number of journeymen, thus causing
extensive lack of employment. It must be remembered
also that the old customs were still in force which
limited editions and prohibited keeping type standing.
It looked to the printers as if the invention of a process
which would fix type by pages and make possible
indefinite reprints from one setting of type was a most
serious threat to the industry. From the point of
view of the knowledge and the conditions in the second
quarter of the eighteenth century we shall have to admit
that their fears were well founded. They could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>possibly foresee the enormous increase of printing
which was to make the stereotype indispensable.</p>

<p class='c007'>To complete the tale of his misfortune, Ged’s partners,
James and Fenner, now fell out between themselves.
The partnership was broken up and Ged, discouraged
and bankrupt, went back to Edinburgh.
His discouragement was not permanent, however, and
he made another attempt, but not a printer could be
found in Edinburgh who would set type for him.
Ged’s son learned composition and set up a few books,
working by night, which were printed at Newcastle.
Ged died in 1749, apparently defeated. Later in the
century, however, his work was taken up and made
practical by Didot in France and his invention developed
to great proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early printers were their own publishers and
booksellers. Previous to the invention of typography
the maker and seller of the book were not ordinarily
the same person. It was only natural that in a short
time the stationers, that is to say, the sellers of manuscript
books and of writing materials, should sell printed
books also. Both the printer and bookseller were interested
in an attempt to cut out one profit. If the printer
sold to the bookseller and the bookseller sold to the
public, both must profit by the transaction. If the
printer could sell directly to the public or the bookseller
could print his own books, obviously the whole
or the greater part of both of these profits might go to
one man. In this competition, however, the bookseller
had three advantages. One came from the fact
that the carrying on of a printing plant was a business
enterprise and the additional care of maintaining
a selling organization for marketing books with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>public was more than most printers were equal to.
The second was that the bookseller could buy a whole
edition or contract for its publication. In this way
while he reduced the printer’s profits he also greatly
reduced his risks. The third was that privilege and
copyright attached themselves to manuscripts. If the
bookseller bought the manuscript it could not be printed
except by arrangement with him. When the bookseller
became the owner of manuscripts, or became
sufficiently confident of his power to market books to
employ the printer to produce such books as he could
use, he became a publisher in the modern sense of the
word. He might either set up a printing establishment
of his own or he might have his work done by
contract by one or more outside printers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The business methods of the old printers were very
simple. We have seen how Schoeffer did the first
piece of commercial printing when he struck off for
distribution a list of the books which he had on sale.
We have seen how Jenson and Aldus and the other
early printers sold their books at their printing offices,
advertised them by correspondence, and sent them to
the Frankfort Fair and other similar places. The
Plantin workshop, which is still maintained as the
Plantin Museum in Antwerp, still shows the little
salesroom which was part of the original business.
Caxton, with his sound business sense and trained
business habits, had a way of assuring or forecasting beforehand
the sales of his books, thus anticipating to a considerable
extent the methods of the modern publishers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It soon became the habit of the printers to open
shops apart from their printing offices for the sale of
their productions. These salesrooms developed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>book-shops through carrying in stock the books of
other printers. In the old-world cities trades had a
habit of congregating in one place. If a man wanted
to open a book-shop, instead of trying to find a good
location where there were no other book-shops very
near at hand, he tried to get a location as near as he
could to all the other book-shops. In this way certain
streets or quarters of the cities, and particularly of
London, were given up to certain industries. The
centre of the English book trade of the seventeenth
century was the churchyard of the old St. Paul’s Church.
This was the smaller church which occupied the site
where now stands the magnificent St. Paul’s Cathedral
built by the great architect Sir Christopher Wren after
the fire of 1660.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glimpse of the way in which the business was
done may be obtained from the following description
of John Day’s book-shop: “He got framed a neat
handsome shop. It was but little and low, a flat roof,
and leaded [covered with sheets of lead] like a terrace,
railed and posted, fit for men to stand upon in
any triumph or show.” Evidently thrifty John Day
was not above turning an honest penny by renting the
roof of his shop to those who desired to see the Lord
Mayor’s show or some other glittering procession. All
processions of any importance passed St. Paul’s. We
are told that this shop cost £40 or £50, which would
be equivalent, making allowance for the difference in
the purchasing power of money, to from $1200 to $1600
to-day. We are told that £150,000 worth of books
were burned at St. Paul’s churchyard and in the crypt
of the church in the fire of 1666. This represents no
less than $4,000,000 in our present money.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Advertising was done largely by means of the so-called
“title post,” a sort of primitive bulletin board.
On a post in the shop were put up the titles of new
books on sale, with perhaps a brief bit of description.
Books were sold either bound, stitched, or in sheets.
The bindings in favor were leather-covered boards,
perhaps vellum with silk ties to counteract the tendency
of vellum to warp, or velvet and other textiles, often
ornamented with elaborate embroidery. The books
which were sold bound, however, were ordinarily in
the plainer styles of binding. The more wealthy and
particular book buyers preferred to buy their books
in sheets and to have them placed in bindings which
were ornamented with their coats of arms or with
other devices of a personal nature. The stitched books
were at first sewed by being pierced through the sheets
with a bodkin and tied with a string. In 1586 a limit
was set to the size and thickness of books which might
be sold in this form. Those beyond the limit must be
sewed on a regular binder’s machine and made ready
for the cover to be put on. Sewed books were often
covered with cloth or pasteboard to preserve them
and keep them clean. This was substantially what
is now known as binding in cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a long time the relations between printers, booksellers,
and authors were confused and irregular. Up
to the end of the seventeenth century there was
nothing in the nature of copyright except registration
with the Stationers’ Company, but that registration
was made by the owner of the manuscript, who
was not necessarily the author. Originally these
owners were generally the printers because the printers
and publishers, as has just been pointed out, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the same. Later, as the ascendency of the booksellers
increased, it was they who held the manuscripts. Sometimes
due regard was paid to the rights of the author
and sometimes not. This appears to have depended
entirely upon the arrangements which author and publisher
were able to make. In many cases the author
got decidedly the worst of the bargain. The protection
which the Company undertook to extend was
limited to the holder of the copyright. The situation
was further complicated by the survival of privileges
or monopolies of various sorts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the end of the seventeenth century, with the
passing away of the mediæval conditions which had
previously prevailed, the Company’s control of the
situation broke down. When the printing acts finally
went into disuse in 1594, as has already been described,
nobody had any protection. Everything in the way of
copyright was entirely abolished. This condition was
soon felt to be intolerable and in 1709 an Act of Parliament
provided a system of copyright and recognized the
author’s right to his work. By this act the owners
of old books and unpublished manuscripts, whether
they were the authors or not, had proprietary right
in them for twenty-one years, beginning April 10,
1710. This part of the act, of course, was a temporary
provision for existing conditions. New books were to
be controlled by the author for fourteen years. If at
the end of that time the author was still living his copyright
might be renewed for fourteen years more. Within
the limits during which the copyright was valid it could
be transferred. Such transference did not act as an
extension. The copyright was secured by registration
with the Stationers’ Company as before.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>This was really a booksellers’ act, as at that time
they held nearly all of the copyrights and doubtless
expected to be able to secure all the new ones of any
value. That was what happened at first. The protection
given to the authors by the new act greatly
altered the terms upon which the booksellers or publishers
could obtain the manuscripts. It was some
years before the authors came to a full realization of
their rights under the new law. When they did arrive
at this knowledge authorship as a profession became
possible. For a long time authors sold their manuscripts
outright to the publishers. The royalty system,
under which the author shares the profits of the work,
was a later development.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time on new work was controlled by the
authors and the use of their manuscripts could be
obtained only by some sort of bargain. All old work
not covered by copyrights existing in 1709, and after
1731 all work upon which copyrights had expired,
might be freely printed by any one. From that time
on the publication of such works became, as it is now,
purely a manufacturing proposition. Whether or not
such books shall be published and whether or not the
publication is a commercial success depend entirely
upon the soundness of the publisher’s judgment and
the accuracy with which he gauges the popular demand
for standard literature at a given price.</p>

<p class='c007'>The publication of new work depends upon a variety
of circumstances. The publisher pays either in cash
or in royalty, or both, according to the prospects of
sale. In case of authors of reputation this prospect
can be reasonably well gauged. In case of unknown
authors the publisher must take a risk if he buys a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>manuscript. In many cases the publisher will require
a guarantee against loss on an edition of a certain size.
He may require this guarantee because he has doubts
about the success of the work or because it is a book
of such limited circulation, although it may be of the
most important character, that the publication will
not be commercially profitable. Of course, if an author
is determined to see himself in print and no publisher
will take his work on any terms, he can hire a printer
to make up an edition, can get it copyrighted, and can
dispose of it in such way as he may find possible or
desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this legislation really dates the differentiation
of the trade. This was a matter of economic growth
rather than of legislation. The author might print
and publish and sell his work, the printer might publish
and sell, the bookseller might print and publish,
but in either case there was an added risk combined
with a possibility of greater profit. Most persons are
content with smaller profits, providing they can be
released from risk. Under the system which now developed
the publisher assumed the risk. In that way
he became the patron of both author and printer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of the modern type of publishers was Jacob
Tonson, the elder, who began business in 1678. A
consideration of the development of the publishing
industry would take us too far afield and it will be
touched upon only as it directly concerns the development
of printing.</p>

<p class='c007'>About 1720 a forward step was taken in the development
of English printing by the entrance of William
Caslon into the field of type-founding. Born in 1692,
we know little of his early life. In 1706 we find him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>then twenty-four years old, carrying on a little business
in London as an engraver of gun locks and a maker of
binders’ tools. Through this last he came in contact with
printers, particularly John Walter and William Bowyer,
the younger, two of the well-known London printers
of that day. His connection with the printing trade,
his artistic skill, and his training as an engraver led
him to undertake the designing and cutting of type,
in which he was encouraged by his printer friends.
His type was immediately successful not only in England
but on the continent, which had hitherto never
looked to England for type. His type was very legible
and had a certain air of distinction which made it
much superior to any English type made at that time.
His roman was regular, graceful, and well proportioned,
a worthy successor of the types of Jenson and Aldus.
His italic was almost as good as his roman. The influence
of Caslon upon English and afterwards upon
American type-cutting has been very great. Many
of the types in most common use are either Caslon’s
letter or some modification of it. This book is printed
in one of the Caslon types. For many years no English
type-founder could compete with him successfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal types of distinction which were then
in the field were three, that of Giambattista Bodoni,
that produced by the Didot family, and that made in
Holland. Bodoni type was characterized by long
ascenders and descenders, over-long serifs, and protracted
hair lines. This general style of letter was
very common in Italy for a long time both in typography
and in manuscript. In the last century the
so-called Italian hand, a handwriting showing these
characteristics, was for a long time very fashionable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>especially among ladies. The Didot type was characterized
by sharp contrasts, the thick lines being very
thick and the thin lines being razor-edged in their thinness.
The Dutch type was rounded and regular with
very little contrast between the thick and the thin
lines. Caslon’s type was a rather successful effort to
retain the good qualities and avoid the defects of all
three. Avoiding the exaggeration of Bodoni, it retained,
though in modified form, the contrasts of Didot and
preserved the regularity of the Dutch without its
monotony and lack of contrast. Toward the end of
the century poor paper, poor presswork, and poor
ink led to an attempt to get clearness and legibility
by thickening the type lines. The result was the introduction,
about 1800, of a very ugly, fat-faced type
which had wide use. Mrs. Caslon, a widow, who was
then in charge of the Caslon foundry, attempted to
meet these demands by thickening the lines of the
Caslon type, producing a modified form which had
considerable success for some time. The old Caslon
was revived by Whittingham about 1845. The better
paper, ink, and presswork of those days revealed anew
the excellence of the Caslon type and since that time it
has never lost favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>An interesting figure of this period is Samuel Richardson
(1689–1761). Richardson was a very good
printer and did a considerable business, but was tempted
into authorship and became one of the first of the
modern English novelists. He wrote, printed, and
published three novels which yet survive, “Pamela,”
“Clarissa Harlowe,” and “Sir Charles Grandison.”
The new vein which these novels struck in English
literature was immediately successful. The novels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>though very long and written in a style which to modern
readers seems anything but lively, were not only
widely successful themselves, but were immediately
imitated, and the good old printer’s modest efforts
were the beginning of the flood of novels which is now
poured out from the press. Because Richardson was
a pioneer his novels are remembered and students of
literature are set to read them, at least in part. It is
doubtful, however, if anybody reads them to-day unless
he has to. It is said that through the treachery of
one of Richardson’s journeymen a Dublin printer got
out a pirated edition of “Sir Charles Grandison” and
sold it in Dublin before Richardson got it bound and
published in London. This was possible because the
English copyright law did not then apply to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>An interesting glimpse of the trade at this period
may be obtained through the pages of Woodfall’s ledger
from 1734 to 1747, which has been published. The
student of these matters can find therein very interesting
material for a study of comparative prices and
the like. One entry shows that he charged for the
printing of Pope’s translation of the Iliad, demy paper,
long primer and brevier, 2000 copies, 6 volumes, 68½
sheets, £143 and 17 shillings, equal to about $1700 in
American money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most interesting and important printer in
the eighteenth century in England was John Baskerville
(1706–1775). Baskerville was of unknown and humble
origin. At seventeen we find him a servant in the house
of a clergyman at Birmingham. He was a good penman,
however, and his employer soon set him to teach
penmanship to the poor boys of the parish and afterwards
got him a position as a teacher of penmanship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and bookkeeping in a school. Baskerville was not only
interested in penmanship but also in the cutting of
letters in stone. Unlike Caslon, this interest did not
lead him directly to take up type-founding or printing
as his life work. In 1736 a man by the name of John
Taylor set himself up in business at Birmingham as
a manufacturer of japanned ware. Baskerville became
interested in Taylor’s work and learned Taylor’s trade
secrets by following him about and whenever he went
into a shop and made a purchase going in himself and
buying the same things in the same quantities. In
this way he learned the composition of the japanning
mixture and shortly set up a business for himself.
This was his main business and source of revenue
throughout his life and was very prosperous. Baskerville
did not imitate Taylor and was hardly his rival,
but won success in making other and better things
than those made by Taylor. Curiously enough, although
Baskerville remained in this business for many
years and was very successful, not a single piece of
work survives which is known to be his. Meanwhile
he did not lose his early interest in the correct formation
of letters and he became actively interested in
type-founding about 1750. By this time, however,
his ideas had spread beyond the mere designing and
founding of type.</p>

<p class='c007'>He conceived the idea of better books than had
yet been made in England. He considered the matter
in its broadest possible aspects. He realized the fact
that a book is the result of many operations. He
believed that the making of the best books, such as
he had in mind, meant the best possible paper, type,
ink, machines, and workmanship. Beginning with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>type; he employed a skilful type-cutter to work from
his designs and is said to have spent £600 or £800
($3000 or $4000) before getting a font to suit him.
He never attempted to cut many types. His roman
differs from Caslon’s, but is equal to it in legibility.
It is beautifully clear, regular, and well proportioned.
Perhaps a certain lack of character and a too mechanical
perfection would be the general criticism which
could be brought against it. His italic was the best
which had as yet been seen in England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baskerville also cut a font of Greek type. This
experiment has been regarded as unsuccessful and his
Greek type has been somewhat criticised. It was unsuccessful,
but not through the fault of the type itself.
His type was excellent, but it differed considerably
from that to which the scholars were then accustomed
and the learned world did not care to adopt it. Minor
changes in the formation of English letters are not
important, providing the general form of the letter is
retained. In languages using a different character,
however, even slight modifications are liable to be
confusing and scholarly conservatism naturally shrinks
from changes of this sort. It is probable, moreover,
that the universities and the few persons doing printing
in Greek did not encourage the new character as
it would have involved a considerable expenditure for
new type. With the comparatively small use for Greek
type one font would last for a very long time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Excellent as Baskerville’s types were, they were not
generally adopted. The printers stuck to the work
of Caslon and Jackson, partly from the fact shortly
to be noted that Baskerville did not get on very well
with the printers and publishers and partly because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of the expense. They preferred sticking to the standard
fonts and buying sorts which could be easily procured
when necessary to undergoing the expense of
buying new fonts from the new founder. Although
the admirers of Baskerville consider his type better
than Caslon’s, it was not enough better to drive it out
of the market. Baskerville’s type, moreover, was
much criticised on its own account. It was claimed
that owing to its proportions and owing to its sharp
contrasts it was hard on the eyes. This criticism,
however, was probably very largely the result of prejudice
and dislike.</p>

<p class='c007'>Benjamin Franklin was a friend of Baskerville and
tells an amusing story about this kind of criticism. He
says that some printers were at his lodging in London and
complained vigorously of the objectionable character
of Baskerville’s type and of the eye strain and headache
which it caused to its users. Franklin thereupon
stepped into another room and came back in a moment
with a sheet of Caslon’s specimens from which he
had removed the heading. He handed this sheet to
the critics who had been berating Baskerville and
praising Caslon and said that he could not help
thinking that they were influenced somewhat by their
prejudice and he wished that they would examine this
sheet and see if they actually did experience the unpleasant
results of which they had complained. Supposing
the sheet to be Baskerville’s type, they studied
it with some care and unanimously declared that they
found the same difficulties and experienced the same
discomforts which they had always met with in reading
Baskerville’s type. Franklin refrained from pointing
out the trap into which he had betrayed them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>but satisfied himself that their criticisms really were
the result of prejudice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Type-founding, however, was only a part of Baskerville’s
scheme. As has been said, he had conceived
the idea of the perfect book, or at least a book nearer
perfection than England had yet seen. It is one of
the most interesting things about Baskerville that he
did not arrive at his conceptions by a process of experimentation
and production of mediocre work. He conceived
his idea and elaborated it in his mind first and
then undertook to realize it in a product. He was
the artist who conceives rather than the craftsman
who slowly elaborates. The designing and cutting of
new fonts of type was only one step in that direction.
He determined that he would attempt to produce the
whole book himself and he therefore set up a printing
office of his own. He selected the paper for his editions
with the greatest care. It is not certain that he
did not even go so far as to make the paper for some
of them, but whether or not this is true he gave it
great attention. He took equal care with his ink,
using every precaution to secure the production of a
bright, clear ink which should work well and be permanent.
He also had a special press built. This did
not involve any innovations in design, but was built
with the greatest care so as to secure the best possible
impression. In order to give smoothness and shine
to his pages and prevent the type from pressing into the
damp paper and making an impression on the reverse
side of the sheet he devised what is known as the hot
press method of finishing. As soon as the damp sheets
came from the press they were placed between plates
of hot metal and subjected to pressure. This gave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>paper a perfectly smooth, shiny surface. This was
another of the points of criticism of Baskerville’s work.
Those who were familiar with the coarse paper and
rough impressions in common use declared that the
shine of the smooth paper hurt their eyes. Baskerville
also gave great attention to the typographical design
of his books. He used ample margins and developed
a style of dignified simplicity, free from extraneous ornamentation
and extremely reserved in the use of all
forms of ornament.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a result of this care Baskerville produced the best
books which had yet been made in England. They were
very expensive. No cost was spared in their production
and there was no catering to the popular taste which
would enable him to reduce unit costs by publishing large
editions. Baskerville frankly printed for the few. He
believed that there were lovers of good books and good
literature who were ready to pay what might be necessary
to obtain their favorite authors in a fitting dress.
In this he was somewhat disappointed. The number
of such persons was less numerous than he had supposed
and it is probable that on the whole Baskerville
lost rather than made money by his printing and type-founding
enterprises. He printed about sixty-seven books,
all of which were reprints of the classics or standard
authors. Not a single new book came from his press,
although these were the flourishing days of Samuel
Johnson, Goldsmith, Pope, Gray, Burke, Chesterfield,
Young, Akenside, and other famous writers. The
booksellers would not support him. He was not willing
to cheapen his work or to lower his prices to meet
their wishes, nor would he consent to being, like so
many printers, a mere servant of the publisher. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>felt that he had his artistic message to give to the world
and he insisted upon giving it in his own way, making
himself his own publisher as well as printer. Very
likely his editions would have made a larger sale if he
had had the support of the booksellers in putting them
on the market, but this was denied him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disheartened and disgusted by the lack of appreciation
and support, Baskerville tried to sell out his
type-foundry, but was unsuccessful. He negotiated
with several of the leading printers of the continent
and with Franklin, but was not able to effect a sale.
Twenty years after his death, however, his type was
used in the famous Boydell Shakspeare. His type
obtained partial recognition. His work has been called
too artistic for his time. It is said that Baskerville was
an artist, but the England of the eighteenth century
was not artistic. Perhaps it might better be said that
Baskerville’s standard of perfection was higher than
his time could appreciate and that he failed because
there was not yet a sufficiently large public ready to
spend considerable money for de luxe book making.
Baskerville unquestionably possessed great taste and
a very high degree of mechanical skill. One does not
find in his work, however, the artist’s spirit which
manifests itself in the work of the old masters or their
late nineteenth century followers. Baskerville’s work,
nevertheless, was not in vain. No man can ever do
anything better than it has yet been done without contributing
to the progress of true art, even though his
productions are appreciated by but few people. Unquestionably
Baskerville’s work influenced the Whittinghams,
who are the great figures in the world of printing
in the early nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>It is interesting to note, before passing to the consideration
of the work of the Whittinghams, that several
of the great English printing houses whose names
are familiar to all readers of books run back far into the
eighteenth century. The Rivington house was established
in 1711, Eyre and Spottiswoode not much later,
Longmans in 1724, John Murray in 1768, William
Blackwood &amp; Son in 1804, A. C. Black in 1815, to mention
only a few of the more familiar. In many cases
these firm names have been several times changed,
but the firms have maintained continuous existence.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Whittinghams and the Modern Book</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Charles Whittingham, the elder, founder
of the business which is now known as the Chiswick
Press, was born in 1767. He began work as
a printer in 1789 on a very small scale. His first
work was small job work such as cards, letterheads,
billheads, and the like. It was not until 1792 that he
did any book work at all. His first job was part of an
edition of Young’s “Night Thoughts.” It was not
uncommon at this time for publishers to parcel out a
book among a number of small printers, giving to each
a certain number of signatures. Like his great predecessor
Day, Whittingham started out doing printing as
badly as anybody else. The work which he did on his
first book order shows all the vices of the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately for the art, Whittingham was not content
to remain a poor printer, although he must have
been perfectly aware that he was such. He early made
the acquaintance of William Caslon, from whom he
bought type and from whom he not improbably received
typographical suggestions. In 1798 he published
a book of a sort much in vogue at that period,
called “Pity’s Gift.” In choice of type, design of
title page, and other regards this book shows a great
improvement over the work of previous years. It
was illustrated and was the beginning of the long series
of illustrated books for which the house afterwards
became famous. The illustrations, however, were poor
in themselves and poorly printed. Here again Whittingham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>began on a level with his contemporaries,
but by study and labor raised himself far above that
level.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few years Whittingham was recognized as the
best printer in England and had built up a good and
profitable business. He won this success in spite of
the fact that he, even more than Baskerville, failed
to get on with the publishers. The publishers wanted
cheap printing and large profits. Whittingham refused
to lower his standards to meet their desires and insisted
on printing to suit himself and, as he believed,
the public. Less ambitious than Baskerville, but
equally conscientious, Whittingham published small
books, well printed, which could be sold at a reasonable
price, although not at the price of trash. He was
right in his estimate of the public demand and, secure
in public support, was able to defy the publishers.
When they refused to give him their work he told them
to keep it, and entirely disregarded their hostility. He
carried the war into the enemies’ country by refusing
to be bound by certain trade customs. These customs
were survivals of the old privileges and monopolies
which kept certain books in certain hands. There was
no foundation for these customs except their antiquity,
and Whittingham proposed to publish certain books
which from time immemorial had been held to be the
property of others. Of course, the publishers called him
a pirate, but he never infringed upon a real copyright
and his conduct in the matter is entirely free from
moral reproach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whittingham was an enterprising business man as
well as desirous of artistic improvement. He bought
the first Stanhope press which was sold to a printing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>house, in 1800, and his house was among the first to
adopt improved machinery and methods of all sorts.
There is, however, one notable exception. Whittingham
and his nephew and successor believed that it
was not possible to do the best work on anything but
a hand press, and no power presses were used in the
Chiswick Press until 1860.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the opening of the century a man by the
name of Potts invented a process for making paper-stock from old rope by removing the tar and dirt.
Whittingham got possession of this process and opened
a paper-stock factory. He did not, however, open a
paper mill, but sold the stock to Fourdrinier, the great
French paper maker. The paper-stock mill was at
Chiswick, and Whittingham opened in 1811 a second
printing office in the neighborhood, which he called
the Chiswick Press. For a time he carried on the two
printing offices, the paper-stock mill, a book-shop, several
publishing ventures, and a business of some sort, it is
not now known what, in Jersey. It was not many
years, however, before he saw the danger of this extension
and gradually disposed of the outside things, concentrating
his interest in the Chiswick Press, which
he preferred to continue rather than the London office.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this period his work steadily continued to
improve. He invented a secret process for giving permanent
brilliancy to his ink. He gave the greatest
attention to the design and layout of his books, proportion
in the matter of margins and the like, and to
presswork. This last was doubly important because
of his determination to improve the process of illustration.
Of course, the modern processes were not
then in use. Black and white was done either from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>wood blocks or steel and copper plates, and color work
was done by the use of solid color on blocks. In order
to secure better results in black and white, Whittingham
invented the over-lay process. Some of his work
in color was the best ever produced by the methods
which were then known. An indication of the resources
of the establishment may be gathered from the story
of the production of his British Poets, sets of which
may still be occasionally bought in old book-shops.
The design for the series was planned in 1819. It was
shortly announced that they were to be published on
a given day in 1822. When the day came the whole
set was published as announced. It consisted of one
hundred royal 18mo  volumes, illustrated. Five hundred
sets were printed, making a total of 50,000 volumes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after this the younger Charles Whittingham,
nephew of the elder, appears upon the scene. He was
his uncle’s apprentice and became his partner in 1824.
The partnership lasted for four years and was apparently
not a very harmonious arrangement. The elder
Whittingham, like many strong and successful men,
was masterful and was not disposed to share either
power or responsibility. The young man, although
having no occasion to complain of any unfairness, felt
that although nominally a partner he was really merely
an employee. In 1828 he left the Chiswick Press and
set up for himself in London. He continued in business
there for ten years and then his uncle, who was now
old and in failing health, called him back to take charge
of the Chiswick Press. In spite of the fact that their
partnership had not been satisfactory, the old man
doubtless realized that his nephew was the only man
in England who was competent to continue the business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>which he had built up with so much toil and in which
he took so much pride. From this time until the date
of the death of the elder man the younger Whittingham
was the moving spirit in the establishment. After
the death of the elder Whittingham the plant was
moved back to London without change of name.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the younger Whittingham took over
the management he became acquainted with William
Pickering and formed an association with him which
had momentous effects on English printing and publishing.
Pickering had started an old-book business
in 1821 and had made money. Although not a practical
printer he was interested in books and he had
very intelligent ideas as to what qualities made books
good, considered as pieces of work. Pickering desired
to publish fine editions of old writers and entered into
an alliance with Whittingham to produce them. For
twenty-five years these two men worked together doing
the best book-making which England had yet seen. Comparatively
little of it was new work. It was mainly
the printing of fine editions of so-called standard literature.
In 1844, dissatisfied with the types in current
use, they induced Henry Caslon, who was then the
head of the Caslon foundry, to revive the old William
Caslon type, known technically as old-face roman, and
this revival was the beginning of the permanent restoration
of the Caslon types to favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pickering and Whittingham together may be said
to be the fathers of the modern book. Together they
worked out many improvements. The excellent work
in illustration which had been developed by the elder
Whittingham was continued and improved. In 1840
they were doing color printing from wood blocks which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>was the best ever done by that process in England,
and later they began to produce ornamental books
with initials, borders, head pieces, and the like, printed
from wood blocks, but superior to anything which had
been seen since the days of illuminated manuscripts.
Pickering and Whittingham were in constant consultation.
They spent their Sundays and much other
time together. The completeness of their cooperation is
shown by Whittingham’s answer to the question which of
the two had the greater influence on the other. He replied,
“My dear sir, when you tell me which half of a pair of
scissors is the more useful, I will answer your question.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pickering died in 1854, bankrupt through indorsing
notes for a friend. The death of Pickering was a great
blow to Whittingham, but the bankruptcy did not in
any way involve the Chiswick Press. Whittingham
never took the same interest in the business afterward,
although the house had become sufficiently strong to
continue and maintain its standards. Whittingham
was always actuated by the true craftsman’s spirit.
He was successful in his business, but he was more
anxious for artistic than for financial success. There
is not the slightest doubt that if he had been willing
to do so he might have amassed a large fortune. Upon
one occasion he was called in as an expert to figure
the price which the government should offer for a very
large contract. Instead of calling for bids the government
had a price figured which it proposed to offer
for the work. Whittingham figured a price which
would be just to the government and at the same
time offer a good margin of profit to the contractor.
After he had completed his labors, he was offered
the contract himself, but refused, stating as he did so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>that he would rather print fine books than make money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of English printing shows one more
epoch-making figure. It is that of William Morris,
poet, socialist, idealist, and craftsman. Morris is in
many ways one of the most picturesque figures of the
nineteenth century. Interested in many kinds of craftsmanship,
he was particularly interested in printing and
in 1891 he set up the Kelmscott Press in order to express
his idea of what a book should be. Morris was
above all things a man of the Middle Ages. Like the
even more famous Ruskin, his spirit revolted from
many of the characteristics of the nineteenth century.
Whatever he did, thought, or said is influenced by this
underlying spirit of mediævalism. In his books and his
types we find exhibited the spirit and forms of the fifteenth
century, but the vital thing is the spirit and not
the form. Although deeply influenced by fifteenth
century forms, Morris’s work is not mere imitation. It
is rather a reproduction of the old-time spirit. Morris
said that in printing it was important to consider “the
paper, the form of the type, the relative spacing of the
letters, words, and lines, and lastly the position of the
printed matter on the page.” The harmony and completeness
of the whole, a harmony extending beyond
mechanism to the harmony of literary spirit and typographic
form, was his fundamental idea. In working this
out he adopted as a unit not the single page of type, as
had been commonly the case, but the double page, on
the ground that when the book is opened we have before
our eyes not one page but two, and therefore the two
together form a unit of book composition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morris designed three types, named from the books
in which they were first employed. The first was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Golden, from the Golden Legend, a heavy black roman
letter with distinct gothic influence. The second was
the Troy, from an edition of Caxton’s Troy book, a
modification of a Koburger gothic of the fifteenth century.
The third was the Chaucer, so called from an
edition of some of Chaucer’s work, which was the Troy
reduced in size and slightly modified in face. The initial
letters were designed by Morris in imitation of a set
used by Sweynheim and Pannartz.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately Morris lived only five years after he
began to print and his press did not survive him. During
that period he published fifty-three books in sixty-five
volumes, none of them in large editions. The
influence of Morris, however, was very great. Although
he was not extensively copied directly, he led in a marked
revival of the spirit of the old craftsman and in a
renewal of the old conception of the unity and harmony
of the book as a whole. The Kelmscott Press was hardly
closed when Charles Ricketts opened the Vale Press,
which operated from 1896 to 1904. Ricketts had much
of the spirit and many of the methods of Morris, but
unlike Morris, who approached his type problem from
the side of manuscript, Ricketts conceived his forms
as cast in metal. Another continuer of Morris’s work
was the Dove Press, which was started in 1900.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morris’s influence extended beyond the Atlantic and
shows itself in some of the best American printing,
particularly that of Mr. Daniel Berkeley Updike of the
Merrymount Press of Boston and Mr. Bruce Rogers of
the Riverside Press of Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The central feature in the history of printing of the
last century has been the development of periodical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and commercial printing. Previous to the last hundred
years the particular thing was the book, but book
printing is now only a small part of the industry. A
study of periodical and commercial printing would be
extremely interesting, but it lies in the domain of typography
rather than in that of the history of printing.
With the brief consideration which we have made of
the so-called revival of printing under Morris and his
successors we may properly take leave of this branch
of our subject.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES FOR APPRENTICES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The following list of publications, comprising the <span class='sc'>Typographic
Technical Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under
the supervision of the Committee on Education of the United
Typothetae of America for use in trade classes, in courses of printing
instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or
group of authors, and carefully edited, the purpose, being to provide
the printers of the United States—employers, journeymen, and
apprentices—with a comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive
compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon the various
branches and specialties of the printing craft, all arranged in orderly
fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p class='c007'>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 × 8 inches.
Their general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been,
as far as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis
of the particular contents and other chief features of each volume will
be found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody
in each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and
clear, with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help
for use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to
the subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Address all orders and inquiries to <span class='sc'>Committee on Education,
United Typothetae of America, Chicago, Illinois, U. S. A.</span></p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid cooperation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries in the United
States of America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified with
this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
